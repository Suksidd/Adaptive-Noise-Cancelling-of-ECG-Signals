# Adaptive-Noise-Cancelling-of-ECG-Signals

Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals obtained from stress examinations are diagnostically significant in detecting several heart diseases, which may not be apparent when the patient is at rest.

However, the noise produced by the environment and by the patient often distorts the ECG data. The respective noise may cause errors in diagnosing the patient's condition, which could be disastrous. 

To prevent this, one must apply proper noise reduction techniques during the production and processing of ECG signals. 

In our project, we have identified three significant sources of noise. Baseline wander noise, Muscle artifact, and electrode motion artifact have come up with a method to suppress each noise type.
